# XFaction
Purpose: Enable better roster visibility and communication between guilds of a confederation. Including guilds on other realms and faction.

- Disclaimer: This addon is in very early stages and currently only guild Eternal Kingdom is being supported.

- Testers: I greatly appreciate your personal time and effort in testing out my idea. Please keep in mind that this is still an alpha build. I am definitely looking forward to and open to your ideas on how to make this better! You can log your bugs/enhancement ideas here: https://github.com/dcwick/XFaction/issues or by sending me Discord DM.

- Known bugs

>Other users not recognizing you logged off.

>BNet whispers going to users not running addon.

>Guild chat being duplicated if you are in guild of origin.

>The first chat from opposite faction has funky formatting. Followup chats are normal formatting. This might be caused by another addon.

- Planned enhancements

>Enable whispering between factions.

>Add configuration dashboard.

>Forward guild message of the day (MOTD).

>Track and display current known bridges.
